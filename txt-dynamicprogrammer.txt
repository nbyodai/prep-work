if you have something you can cache then you have dynamic programming


sub problems ->

memoization is the caching a return value of a function based on it;s parameters.
so if the parameters doesn't change then it's memoized


dynamic programming
divide & conquer + memoization


1 can be divided into subproblems
2 recursive solution
3 are there repetitive subproblems
4 memoize subproblems
