Data structures is the way we organize our data


Operations on Data structures
Insertion
Deletion
Traversal
Searching/look up
Sorting
Access


ARRAYS (lists)
- organizes items sequentially, one after the other
- since storage is contiguous, they have the smallest footprint

push O(1)
pop O(1)
unshift O(n)
splice O(n)


Static Arrays are fixed in size


Dynamic Arrays allows us not to think about memory management
- expands as the elements are added.



segway -
reference types
- objects in javascript (reference types) hold addresses to the data type that is then typically created by the programmer
- that is why [] === [] gives false; because both are creating new addresses/references

Context vs scope
- scope exists inside curly braces for javascript
- context lets us know what object we are/using





ARRAYS
- in javascript are just objects with integer based keys


thing of strings as Arrays
