Data structures is the way we organise our data


Operations on Data structures
Insertion
Deletion
Traversal
Searching
Sorting
Access


ARRAYS (lists)
- organises items sequentially, one after the other
- since store contiguosly, they have the smallest footprint

push O(1)
pop O(1)
unshift O(n)
splice O(n)


Static Arrays are fixed in size


Dynamic Arrays allows us not to think about memory management
- expands as the elements are added.



segway -
reference types
- objects in javascript (referrence types) hold addressess to the data type that is then typciaclly created by the programmer
- that is why [] === [] gives false; because both are creating new addresses/references

Context vs scope
- scope exists inside curly braces for javascript
- context lets us know what object we are/using





ARRAYS
- in javascript are just objects with integer based keys


thing of strings as Arrays
