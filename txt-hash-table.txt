A hash table exists across computer science as python dictonaries, javascript objects

it allows to store data in memory as key-value pair

where the key is passed through something known as a hash function

a hashfunction is a one way procedure that takes an input and returns an encoded string.

It gives the same output encoding for the same input everytime (Imdempotent)


hashfunction is called whenee=ver we add a property to memory or retrieve from memory
also map the encoded string to a memory addresses



with hash tables we cannot avoid collisions
with enough data with limited memory collissions will happen

insert O(1)
lookup O(1) although it might be O(n) depending on the hash function
search O(1)
delete O(1)
two common ways to deal with collisions -
- linkedlist

in JS in an ob ject we can only save string keyss
MAP can store anything as keys like function or arrays (it maintains order too)
Set is like Map but it only stores keys.

it has unordered
