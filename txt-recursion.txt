define something in terms of itself

a function that refers to itself


repeated sub tasks to do is where recursion thrives

the computer needs to add memory and remember them

overflow can happen, and this would cause our systems to crashh


recursion always has a base cause

and then also return the recursive cause

get lower and lower to get to your base cause


any problem that can be solved with recursion can be solved iteratively
