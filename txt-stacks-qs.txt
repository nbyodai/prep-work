linear data structures
- allow us to traverse one by one in which only one can be reached

STACKS
- plates, on top of each other, touch the top plate
- LIFO, last in first out,

examples - very last value, function calls, undo, browser back and forth


pop, push, peek
remove, add, look at top



Qs
lines
FIFO
 - wait list
 - uber / lyft /
 - printer job

nQ - add to line
dQ - remove from front
peek - look at front

removing from arrays leads to shifting exercise to update the indexes

STACKS
Arrays vs LL
- have cache locality vs scattered all over the place
- static/dynamic array vs more memory that is dynamic and things can be added



Qs
Arrays vs LL
LL is better
